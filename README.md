This project is about automatic disposable account creation for https://creator.nightcafe.studio

It also has features to complete tasks such as profile completion and liking published creations for extra credits.

# How to use:

- Install all required imported libraries (check requirements.txt !!INCOMPLETE!!)
- Download msedgedriver at https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/ (put it in the same folder as the python script)
- Just run it

# Running multiple at a time:

- You can run multiple at a time, just make sure not to minimize any, having them behind other windows or not as active window is fine as long as they're not minimized.
- Also, only start the next script once the email verification of the previous one has completed. (otherwise verifMail.txt will overwrite each other)
